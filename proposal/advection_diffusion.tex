The advection--diffusion (AD) equation (sometimes known as the
convection--diffusion or drift--diffusion equation) describes physical
systems whose evolution is due to two processes, diffusion and
convection.  It AD equation can be derived from the continuity
equation.  The general form of the AD equation is
\begin{align}
  u_t = \nabla\cdot(D\nabla u) - \nabla \cdot (\vec{b} u),
  \label{eqn:advection_diffusion}
\end{align}
where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\vec{b}$ is the
convection velocity.  

The diffusion process introduces a time-step restriction for purely
explicit schemes.  Hence, a semi-implicit integrator (e.g. an
implicit--explicit scheme) is often used to evolve the system, where
the (stiff) diffusive term is handled implicitly, and the (non-stiff)
advective term is handled explicitly.  There are several approaches to
generate the system of ODEs
\begin{align*}
  \frac{du}{dt} = f_{stiff}(t,u) + f_{nonstiff}(t,u) 
\end{align*}
from equation~\eqref{eqn:advection_diffusion} that will allow us to
apply the semi-implicit time integrator.  Several discretizations for
replacing the spatial derivatives by algebraic expressions are
provided in this benchmarking suite.

\item A finite difference discretization
\item A finite volume discretization
\item A spectral discretization
