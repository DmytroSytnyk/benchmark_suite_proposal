Lattice Boltzmann simulation (D2Q9, BGK model) for various setups. To choose and adapt the respective scenario, modify main.cpp accordingly. To compile the code, run "make" in src-directory. To run the simulation, run "./lbsim". The simulation can write vtk-compatible output files.
src/
CollideStream*: contains the basic LB algorithm and boundary treatment
LBScenario.h  : defines different scenarios (e.g., "taylorgreen" and "couette")
LBField.*     : data structure for flow field and particle distribution functions
VTK.h         : for vtk-compatible output
main.cpp      : sets together all simulation pieces

Results are given in:
- taylor_green.ods
  -> point data for cell 15x15 in N=32 Taylor-Green setup, and for cell 31x31 in N=64 Taylor-Green setup
- couette.ods
  -> profile data for velocity profile v_0(x_1) in 32x32 and 64x64 Couette setup
